Assumptions
1) All input is valid
2) Robot looking north to begin

How to use:
in command prompt or PowerShell type "python RobotMovement.py"
Enter movement instructions eg "B1,R1,F4,L3,B1"

Deciding how to do this, I initially researched some location algorithms to see if I could find one to calculate position (extensibility incase mazes are added)
Looking into it, there were a lot of issues I would face in a short amount of time (only till the following morning) so I settled with some basic movement tracking and maths to find the quickest way home.
